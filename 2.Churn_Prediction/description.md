![Churn Prediction](Images/Churn.jpg)

## Project Overview:
The paper delves into predicting churn in the credit card industry through a Random Forest classifier. It emphasises the criticality of early detection of customer defections in subscription-based models and traditional financial landscapes. The research aims for high prediction accuracy and identifies influential features for churn prediction.

A structured approach is adopted to develop data understanding, preparation, algorithm selection, modelling, and evaluation. All the steps for data preprocessing, handling imbalanced data, feature selection, engineering, and model parameter tuning are presented.

Models are extensively evaluated using accuracy, precision, sensitivity, specificity, R.O.C. curves, A.U.C. and confusion matrices.

Furthermore, the analysis delves into the practical implications of predictive analytics in business discussing both technical and practical implications, while also suggesting areas for further improvement and development.
