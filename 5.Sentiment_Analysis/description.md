![Sentiment Analysis](Images/Sentiment.jpg)

## Project Overview:
The sentiment analysis project aims to evaluate public sentiment and perceptions regarding Airbnb by analyzing Twitter data. Leveraging natural language processing techniques, this study scrutinizes a diverse range of tweets to gauge the general sentiment—positive, negative, or neutral—towards Airbnb. The process involves data collection through Twitter API, followed by data cleaning to eliminate irrelevant or spam content. 

Utilizing machine learning algorithms and sentiment analysis tools, the collected tweets undergo sentiment classification, assigning polarity scores to discern opinions expressed. By analyzing linguistic patterns, emotions, and contextual cues, the project unveils prevalent sentiments associated with Airbnb services, accommodations, user experiences, and customer satisfaction.

Furthermore, sentiment trends and key themes are identified to understand users' perceptions, concerns, and areas of satisfaction linked to Airbnb's offerings. The project's findings are presented through visualizations, sentiment distribution graphs, and sentiment-topic modeling to offer comprehensive insights into the public perception landscape surrounding Airbnb on Twitter. This analysis can assist Airbnb in understanding consumer sentiments, addressing concerns, and enhancing user experiences.
