![Sentiment Analysis](Images/Sentiment.jpg)

## Project Overview:
This sentiment analysis aims at evaluating public sentiment and perceptions regarding Airbnb by analyzing Twitter data. Leveraging natural language processing techniques, it scrutinizes a diverse range of tweets to gauge the general sentiment, positive, negative, or neutral, towards the company. The process involves data collection through Twitter API, followed by data cleaning to eliminate irrelevant or spam content. 

Utilizing statistical techniques and sentiment analysis tools, the collected tweets undergo sentiment classification, assigning polarity scores to discern opinions expressed. By analyzing linguistic patterns, emotions, and contextual cues, the project unveils prevalent sentiments associated with Airbnb services, accommodations, user experiences, and customer satisfaction.

Furthermore, sentiment trends and key themes are identified to understand users' perceptions, concerns, and areas of satisfaction linked to Airbnb's offerings. The project's findings are presented through visualizations, sentiment distribution graphs to offer comprehensive insights into the public perception landscape surrounding Airbnb on Twitter.
