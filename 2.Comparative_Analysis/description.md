# Machine Learning: a Comparative Analysis
![Comparative Analysis](Images/Comparative.jpg)

## Project Overview:
The predictive ability of five machine learning algorithms is compared across diverse datasets. The analysis addresses real-world challenges in different industries: churn prediction in subscription-based businesses, term deposit subscriptions in relation to telemarketing campaigns, and energy consumption forecasting.

A structured approach is adopted to develop data understanding, preparation, algorithm selection, modelling, and evaluation. All the steps for data preprocessing, handling imbalanced data, feature selection, engineering, and model parameter tuning are presented.

Models are extensively evaluated using accuracy, precision, sensitivity, specificity, R.O.C. curves, A.U.C., M.S.E., R.M.S.E., R-squared, and confusion matrices.

Furthermore, the analysis delves into the practical implications of predictive analytics in business discussing both technical and practical implications, while also suggesting areas for further improvement and development.
