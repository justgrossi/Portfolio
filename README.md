Collection of data science projects where artificial intelligence, machine learning, data analysis and visualisation techniques are applied within diverse domains to showcase the skills and expertise acquired.

## Projects
1. [Sales Prediction](https://github.com/justgrossi/Portfolio/blob/main/1.Sales_Prediction/description.md)
   - **Description:** The analysis offers a comprehensive examination of predictive modelling in eCommerce, presenting a well-structured methodology and discussing both technical and practical implications, while also suggesting areas for further improvement and development.
   - **Algorithm:** Random Forest.
   - **Objective:** Create a model able to accurately predict browsing sessions leading to a purchase and offering insights into the most influential features for online purchases.
2. [Comparative Analysis](https://github.com/justgrossi/Portfolio/blob/main/2.Comparative_Analysis/description.md)
  - **Description:** The analysis offers a comparative analysis of five machine learning algorithms in relation to three different domains presenting a well-structured methodology and discussing both technical and practical implications, while also suggesting areas for further improvement and development.
   - **Algorithm:** Decision trees, Random Forests, Gradient Boosting, K-Nearest neighbour, and Support Vector Machine.
   - **Objective:** Address real-world challenges in different industries: churn prediction in subscription-based businesses, term deposit subscriptions in telemarketing campaigns, and energy consumption forecasting.
